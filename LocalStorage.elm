This library offers rudimentary access to the browser's localStorage, which is
limited to string keys and values. It uses Elm Tasks for storage IO.

Retrieve the string value for a given key. Yields Maybe.Nothing if the key
does not exist in storage. Task will fail with NoStorage if localStorage is
not available in the browser:

    result : Signal.Mailbox String
    result = Signal.mailbox "loading..."

    main : Signal Element
    main = Signal.map show result.signal

    port getStorage : Task LocalStorage.Error ()

Retrieves the value for a given key and parses it using the provided JSON
decoder. Yields Maybe.Nothing if the key does not exist in storage. Task will
fail with NoStorage if localStorage is not available in the browser, or
UnexpectedPayload if there was a parsing error:

    result : Signal.Mailbox String
    result = Signal.mailbox "loading..."

    main : Signal Element
    main = Signal.map show result.signal

    port getStorage : Task LocalStorage.Error ()

Sets the string value for a given key and passes through the string value as
the task result for chaining. Task will fail with NoStorage if localStorage is
not available in the browser:

    port setStorage : Signal (Task LocalStorage.Error String)
    port setStorage =
      Signal.map (LocalStorage.set storageKey) someStringSignal

set : String -> String -> Task Error String
set =

Removes the value for a given key and passes through the string key as the
task result for chaining. Task will fail with NoStorage if localStorage is
not available in the browser:

    port removeStorage : Signal (Task LocalStorage.Error String)
    port removeStorage =
      Signal.map (LocalStorage.remove storageKey) someStringSignal
